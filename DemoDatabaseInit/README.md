# DemoDatabaseInit

Creates the dinosaur database. 

Uses DemoModel to define the database. Database access is setup in app.confg. 
Just because it is not worth the hassle of fighting Microsofts Entity Framework 
when tring to put the database access information someplace else. 

It would be nice to be able to use centralized configuration. Microsoft thinks
otherwise.
