## **How to contribute to XAS**

So you have used the framework and liked what you saw and want to contribute back. For that, thanks. Contributions are gladly accepted when they follow the below guide lines.

### **Contributions**

All contributed code, documentation and patches will be licensed under the Artistic License 2.0, just like the rest of the code base. This is known as the [​inbound=outbound](http://ebb.org/bkuhn/blog/2014/06/09/do-not-need-cla.html) principle.

Additionally, any contributed modules, code or documentation, must have an author and copyright/license attributions, like the ones at the bottom of this document. That way, I know who contributed what.

### **Donations**

I will gladly accept money donations. You can donate thru [​PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/home). My email is in the code. The donation doesn't obligate me in any way or fashion to provide a service. Please use the "Friends and Family" option when sending the donation.
