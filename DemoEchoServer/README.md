# DemoEchoServer

A simple echo server. Just like UNIX! Not really, the default UNIX echo server is 
very simple. Usually written in less the 30 lines of C code and runs from the 
xinet daemon.

This server can run as a standalone service, has client trottling with client 
connection timeouts and can make use of SSL.

Demostrates the XAS.Network.TCP.Server class.
