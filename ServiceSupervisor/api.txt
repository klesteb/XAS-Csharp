REST based access to the Supervisor. 

There is no html interface, so you must set the "Accept" header, this should be either 
"application/json" or "application/hal+json" to use a "discoverable" REST interface. All 
access is authenticated using HTTP Basic Authentication, the username and password 
depends on the Windows Domain that the server resides in.

All interaction with the micro services strives to follow industry standards. In this 
respect the following standards are followed:

	“application/hal+json” => https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal-08
	“application/problem+json” => https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807
	“application/json” => https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4627.txt

They also strive to follow current operations theory on how to create distributed 
web based applications that are outlined in various blogs, online forums, published 
thesis and trade publications.

Service Responses

When a GET is done to the service root, i.e. “/”, a JSON data structure will be returned. 
This is to help with HAL based discovery. By default all responses will depend on the HTTP 
“Accept-Type” header. If one is not set, you will get a “Content-Type: application/hal+json” 
response. Valid “Accept-Type” headers can be either “application/hal+json” or “application/json”.  
If an error is encountered, the response will be “Content-Type: application/problem+json”.

The following HTTP status codes are used:

	200 – OK
	202 – Accepted
	204 - NoContent
	400 – BadRequest – usually failed authentication.
	401 – Unauthorized 
	402 – Forbidden
	404 – NotFoundError
	406 – NotAccecptable
	411 – LengthRequired
	422 – UnprocessableEntity
	500 – InternalServerError
	501 - NotImplemented
	503 – ServiceUnavailable
